# CS3340-Group-Project
The most recent upload of the project file reads an asm file and then handles it line by line. Play with it and try to bridge it to your instruction handling functions. Right now it just prints out every instruction line with the number of arguments that each line uses. See the comment for how each argument number should be interpreted.


The .data and .text directives still need to be split and handled separately but right now, there should be enough here to test the instruction-handling routines.
